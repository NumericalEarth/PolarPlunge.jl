    "\n",
    "We solve the **2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations**:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$$\n",

    "- $p$ is the pressure (divided by density)\n",

    "\n",
    "We replace the derivative in time with its discrete counterpart (assuming we take small enough timesteps!) <br>\n",
    "For simplicity we use the simplest possible treatment of the equations, and evaluate the right hand side at time known time instant. <br>\n",
    "This method (called Forward Euler), can be numerically unstable, but avoids any complication coming from complex implicit terms\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\\Delta t} = RHS^n$$\n",

    "where $\\Delta t$ is our discrete time step and $n$ indicates the index of the discrete time instant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Projection Method\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 3 equations for 3 variables ($u^{n+1}$, $v^{n+1}$, $p^{n+1}$) -> The system is solvable! <br>\n",
    "However, there is a complication: while $u^{n+1}$ and $v^{n+1}$ have explicit formulas to update their values, we still have no expression for $p^{n+1}$! <br> \n",
    "We use a very simple but smart trick, called the **projection method** (Chorin, 1968) to solve these equations. <br>\n",
    "The idea is to split each time step into a *predictor* that ignores the pressure, and a *correction* that enforces incompressibility.\n",

    "**Step 1 \u2014 Predictor (ignore pressure):**\n",

    "\n",
    "The predicted velocity $\\mathbf{u}^*$ is generally **not divergence-free** ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^* \\neq 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 \u2014 Correction (enforce incompressibility):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find a pressure $p$ such that the corrected velocity is divergence-free:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^* - \\Delta t \\, \\nabla p^{n+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The incompressibility requires a good estimate of pressure!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 \u2014 Deriving the Poisson equation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We require $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = 0$. Taking the divergence of the correction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^* - \\Delta t \\, \\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\nabla^2 p^{n+1}  = \\frac{\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\Delta t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **Poisson equation** for $p$, with the divergence of the predicted velocity as the source term. Once solved, the pressure gradient projects $\\mathbf{u}^*$ onto the space of divergence-free fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of the algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute tendencies**: $G^n = -(\\mathbf{u}^n \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u}^n + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}^n$\n",
    "2. **Predictor step**: $\\mathbf{u}^* = \\mathbf{u}^n + \\Delta t \\cdot G^n$\n",
    "3. **Pressure solve**: $\\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = \\dfrac{\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\Delta t}$\n",
    "4. **Correction**: $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^* - \\Delta t \\, \\nabla p^{n+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: the pressure acts as a **Lagrange multiplier** that enforces incompressibility. The name \"projection\" comes from the fact that the correction step is an orthogonal projection of $\\mathbf{u}^*$ onto the subspace of divergence-free vector fields."

    "\n",
    "The Laplacian $\\nabla^2$ is diagonal in Fourier space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 p = f \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -(k_x^2 + k_y^2) \\hat{p} = \\hat{f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the algorithm is:\n",
    "1. FFT the right-hand side: $\\hat{f} = \\mathcal{F}(f)$\n",
    "2. Divide by eigenvalues: $\\hat{p} = -\\hat{f} / (k_x^2 + k_y^2)$\n",
    "3. Inverse FFT: $p = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\hat{p})$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity**: $O(N^2 \\log N)$ vs $O(N^4)$ for direct methods!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Discrete Eigenvalues, Not $k_x^2 + k_y^2$?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might expect to use the **continuous** Laplacian eigenvalues $k_x^2 + k_y^2$ where $k_x = 2\\pi m / L_x$. But we must use the **discrete** Laplacian eigenvalues instead!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The reason**: We're solving the *discrete* Poisson equation, not the continuous one. Our discrete Laplacian is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\nabla^2 p)_{i,j} = \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - 2p_{i,j} + p_{i-1,j}}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{p_{i,j+1} - 2p_{i,j} + p_{i,j-1}}{\\Delta y^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we substitute $p_{i,j} = \\hat{p} \\cdot e^{i(k_x x_i + k_y y_j)}$ into this stencil, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2_{\\text{discrete}} \\rightarrow -\\frac{4\\sin^2(\\pi m / N_x)}{\\Delta x^2} - \\frac{4\\sin^2(\\pi n / N_y)}{\\Delta y^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not** $-k_x^2 - k_y^2$!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens if we use the wrong eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used $k_x^2 + k_y^2$:\n",
    "- The pressure solve would give the wrong answer\n",
    "- The correction step $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^* - \\Delta t \\nabla p$ wouldn't properly remove divergence\n",
    "- We'd lose the beautiful property that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ to machine precision\n",
